# Flight Control System



The flight cnntrol system is the core inside the drone and it keeps drone steady under all conditions.  The following flight control system forks from `ArkLab` (http://www.arklab.tw/). I use different sensors to add some new features to improve the flight control system. 



**I also have another open drone project to open source all the design how to create a drone from scratch.**



## Architecture 



The basic hardware components are:

* Arduino Pro Min (5V, 16Hz) /w ATmega328
* MPU6050
* Bluetooth HC05 / HC06
* Coreless motor 



The software using are:

* MultiWii 
* MultiWill EZ GUI : Flying system



## Implement



Here we use `Butterfly 2.0` made by `ArkLab` as the target to run the improved FCS.
